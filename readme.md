# The Helix Programming Language
Helix - a high-level programming language designed to be fast, expressive, and easy to use. It is written in Rust, a systems programming language that provides both speed and memory safety. 

### Features
- Simple syntax and semantics
- Dynamic typing 
- First-class functions and closures
- Fast and efficient runtime
- Easy to learn


### Examples
Here is a simple Helix program that prints "Hello, world!":

```helix
io.print("Hello, world!")
```

### Installation
To install the Helix runtime environment, checkout the [releases](https://github.com/arjpeg/helix/releases) page. From there, you can download the latest version for your operating system. For more information, see the [installation guide](https://github.com/arjpeg/helix/wiki/Installation).

### Documentation
